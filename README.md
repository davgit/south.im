# WDS 2013 Opening Titles #

The opening titles for
[Web Direction South 2013](http://webdirections.org/wds13/):
a entirely browser-based animation powered by WebGL,
[browserify](http://browserify.org/) and
[npm](http://npmjs.org/).

Check out the finished product at [run.south.im](http://run.south.im/).

## Setup ##

To get the code on your system and install the required dependencies:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:smallmultiples/wds2013.git
cd wds2013
npm install
```

If you're just looking to get it running locally:

``` bash
npm start
```

Otherwise, you can run `make` to set off the following tasks:

``` bash
# Starts a local development server using beefy
make start
# Builds the production-ready assets
make build
# Removes any generated assets
make clean
# Visualise file size consumption using disc
make disc
open dist/disc.html
# Visualise the project's dependency tree using colony
make colony
open dist/colony/index.html
```

## Related Code ##

If you're wondering about specific bits of functionality, most of the final
code is actually contained in modules which are freely available on
[npm](http://npmjs.org/). These ones might be of particular interest:

* [browserify](http://browserify.org): handles building the final script, letting us use CommonJS modules from [npm](http://npmjs.org) and elsewhere.
* [glslify](http://github.com/chrisdickinson/glslify): a browserify-like bundler for GLSL shaders.
* [ndarray](http://github.com/mikolalysenko/ndarray): a very versatile/performant module for handling multidimensional arrays with a wealth of compatible modules.
* [level.js](http://github.com/maxogden/level.js): a [level*](http://github.com/level) API wrapper for IndexedDB. Used in combination with [continuous-storage](http://github.com/hughsk/continuous-storage) to cache generated terrain.
* [webworkify](http://github.com/substack/webworkify): Used in combination with [worker-wrap](http://github.com/hughsk/worker-wrap) for generating terrain meshes in a separate thread.
* [perlin](https://github.com/maxogden/js.perlin): a Javascript perlin noise implementation, used to generate the terrain.
* [ndarray-continuous](http://github.com/hughsk/ndarray-continuous): an API for handling dynamic grids of ndarrays, so we can easily load/unload chunks of terrain dynamically.
* [heightmap-mesher](http://github.com/hughsk/heightmap-mesher): takes a heightmap and converts it into 3D triangles.
* [orbit-camera](http://github.com/mikolalysenko/orbit-camera): a simple arcball camera built on top of gl-matrix.
* [talkie](http://github.com/hughsk/talkie): handles queueing events in a timeline such that they can be triggered at certain parts of the song.
* [lut](http://github.com/hughsk/lut): generates generic color tables as a starting point for color grading.
* [gl-matrix](http://glmatrix.net): a very performant JS matrix library.
* [gl-now](http://github.com/mikolalysenko/gl-now): a variant of [game-shell](http://github.com/game-shell) for WebGL demos to handle bootstrapping the 3D context.
* [glsl-point-light](http://github.com/hughsk/glsl-point-light): A reusable point light function for GLSL.
* [glsl-fog](http://github.com/hughsk/glsl-fog): A reusable set of fog functions for GLSL.
* [webgl-noise](https://github.com/ashima/webgl-noise): perlin/simplex/classic noise in GLSL.
* [web-audio-analyser](http://github.com/hughsk/web-audio-analyser): A drop-in module for getting audio analysis data from the Web Audio API.
* [beats](http://github.com/hughsk/beats): naive beat detection.
* [dot-obj](http://github.com/hughsk/dot-obj): A parser for the `.obj` geometry format. Used to include models exported from Blender.
